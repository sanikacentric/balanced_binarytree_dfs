# ⚖️ Balanced Binary Tree (DFS)

Python solution for checking if a binary tree is height-balanced using Depth-First Search.

## 🎯 Problem

Given a binary tree, determine if it is height-balanced (the depth of the two subtrees of every node never differs by more than one).

## 💡 Approach

- **Bottom-Up DFS** — O(n) time, check balance while computing height
- - Return -1 for unbalanced subtrees to short-circuit early
